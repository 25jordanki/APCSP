	<p>The 22-23 school year was an eventful one. I participated in a ton of different classes including History,English, Chemistry, Math, Spanish, Health Science, and APCSP. I spent a ton of time working on my classes because this years classes were a lot harder than the ones last year. Overall I am trying to finish this year strong with straight A's.</p>
